HPPRINT is a small program to send data to a HP printer connected via
network and a HP JetDirect card (in the printer). It can be used
together with PRINTMON to redirect an OS/2 printer queue to the
network connected printer. A sample usage is:

	PRINTMON lpt1 "HPPRINT -h laser"

where lpt1 is the port to redirect and laser is the "host name" of
your printer. It must be defined in your hosts file or by your domain
name server. Alternatively it can be an IP address in dotted-decimal
notation. Optionally, the program accepts a port number with the -p
option, it can be either a port name defined in the services file or a
directly specified number.

Note that to get your printer working you must have a bootpd server
daemon running on some machine in the LAN and have a proper definition
for your printer in the bootptab file. Example:

  global.dummy:\
	  :sm=255.255.255.0:\
	  :hd=/bootpd/trypd:bf=null:\
	  :ds=1.1.1.6:

  laser.your.domain: tc=global.dummy: ht=ethernet:\
       ha=080009568a6f: ip=1.2.3.4: hn:

Please don't ask me in case of problems, there can be too many. Make
sure you can ping your printer before attempting to use HPPRINT.

The program requires the EMX runtime DLL's, get the latest emxrt.zip
which contains it. It also requires the IBM TCP/IP 2.0 socket DLL's
(tcp32dll.dll and so32dll.dll).

This program is freeware. The author is not responsible in any way for
any problem caused by it, even if the program is used correctly.
